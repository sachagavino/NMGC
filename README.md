# Nautilus Multi Grain Code (NMGC); version 2.1 (August 2023)
This repository contains the full NMGC package (Ruaud et al. 2016; Iqbal & Wakelam 2018, Gavino et al. 2021).

WARNING: This is ugly but please, use python 2.7 to compile, for now.

### UPDATES August 2023:
- 0D models now works in multi-grain mode.
- The approximation for the UV factor is removed so that 1D models can be something else than a disk.
- parameters.in file is simplified. Expect more updates soon.
